Project Title: Battery Aging Analysis and Prediction using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Machine Learning
Project Description
This project aims to analyze the aging process of a battery using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and incremental capacity analysis (dQ/dV). It also utilizes machine learning techniques to predict battery aging cycles based on impedance data. The project is divided into three key components:

Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded from a MATLAB .mat file, containing measurements such as:
Re(Z) (Real part of Impedance)
Im(Z) (Imaginary part of Impedance)
Cycle count (Battery aging indicator)
Voltage vs. Capacity data
The data is processed to ensure consistency and correctness before analysis.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Analysis

A 3D scatter plot visualizes the relationship between:
Real Impedance (ReZ)
Imaginary Impedance (ImZ)
Battery Cycle Count
This helps in identifying trends and degradation patterns over aging cycles.
Incremental Capacity Analysis (dQ/dV)

The dQ/dV vs. Voltage analysis is a common technique used to detect battery degradation.
A 3D plot of dQ/dV vs. Voltage vs. Cycle Count is generated to observe capacity fading over time.
Machine Learning Model for Battery Aging Prediction

A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict the battery cycle count using impedance data.
Feature selection includes:
Re(Z) and Im(Z) as input features
Cycle count as the target variable
The model is evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
RÂ² Score
Feature importance analysis identifies the impact of Re(Z) and Im(Z) on battery aging.
Objectives
